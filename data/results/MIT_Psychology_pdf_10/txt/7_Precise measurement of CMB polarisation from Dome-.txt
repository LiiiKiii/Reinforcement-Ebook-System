论文标题: Precise measurement of CMB polarisation from Dome-C: the BRAIN and CLOVER experiments
作者: M. Piat, C. Rosset, the BRAIN, CLOVER Collaboration
摘要: The characterisation of CMB polarisation is one of the next challenge in observationnal cosmology. This is especially true for the so-called B-modes that are at least 3 order of magnitude lower than CMB temperature fluctuations. A precise measurement of the angular power spectrum of these B-modes will give important constraints on inflation parameters. In this talk, I will describe two complementary experiments, BRAIN and CLOVER, dedicated to CMB polarisation measurement. These experiments are proposed to be installed in Dome-C, Antarctica, to take advantage of the extreme dryness of the atmosphere and to allow long integration time.
