摘要: Based on nonlinear prediction and information theory, vertical heterogeneity of predictability and information loss rate was obtained over the Northern Hemisphere. In seasonal to interannual time scales, the predictability is low in lower troposphere and high in mid-upper troposphere. But within mid-upper subtropics troposphere over some ocean area there is a relatively poor prediction. The conclusions fit the seasonal time scale too. When it goes to the interannual time scale, the predictability is high in lower troposphere and low in mid-upper troposphere contrary to the formers. And on the whole the interannual trend is more predictable than the seasonal trend. The average information loss rate is low over mid-east Pacific, west of North America, Atlantic and Eurasia, and the atmosphere over other places have a relatively high information loss rate in all time scales. Two channels were found steadily over the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean in subtropics. There exist unstable chann...
