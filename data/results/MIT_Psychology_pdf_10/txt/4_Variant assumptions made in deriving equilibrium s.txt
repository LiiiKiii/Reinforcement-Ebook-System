摘要: The paper of Little et al. (PloS Comput Biol 2009 5(10) e1000539) outlined a system of reaction-diffusion equations that were used to describe induction of atherosclerotic disease. These were solved by considering an equilibrium solution and small perturbations around this equilibrium. Here we consider slight variant sets of assumptions that could be used to derive equilibrium solutions. In general they do not imply any change in the numerical results relating to monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1) presented in that paper.
