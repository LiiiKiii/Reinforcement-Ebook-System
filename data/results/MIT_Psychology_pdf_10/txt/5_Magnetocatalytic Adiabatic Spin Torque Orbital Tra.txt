论文标题: Magnetocatalytic Adiabatic Spin Torque Orbital Transformations for Novel Chemical and Catalytic Reaction Dynamics: The Little Effect
作者: Reginald B. Little
摘要: In this manuscript the theory and phenomena associated with the Little Effect are introduced as the spin induced orbital dynamics of confined fermions under strong magnetic and thermal environments. This Little Effect is considered in details for the electron transfer reactions associated with redox processes of Cu-Ag alloy within deionized water and for the orbital dynamics during the iron catalyzed covalent bond rearrangements associated with amorphous carbon conversion to diamond. Furthermore, prolong extreme conditions of 74,000 amps, 403 V, strong Lorentz compression, and thermal stresses upon this Cu-Ag- H2O system on the basis of the Little Effect of high spin, thermally induced orbital dynamics are predicted and demonstrated to cause the magnetically organized reverse beta, electron capture, proton capture and neutron capture processes for various infrequent pycnonuclear transmutations within the Cu-Ag coil. The general experimental verification and the broad implications of th...
