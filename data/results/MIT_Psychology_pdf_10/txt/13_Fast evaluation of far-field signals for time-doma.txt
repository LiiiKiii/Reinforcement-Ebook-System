论文标题: Fast evaluation of far-field signals for time-domain wave propagation
作者: Scott E. Field, Stephen R. Lau
摘要: Time-domain simulation of wave phenomena on a finite computational domain often requires a fictitious outer boundary. An important practical issue is the specification of appropriate boundary conditions on this boundary, often conditions of complete transparency. Attention to this issue has been paid elsewhere, and here we consider a different, although related, issue: far-field signal recovery. Namely, from smooth data recorded on the outer boundary we wish to recover the far-field signal which would reach arbitrarily large distances. These signals encode information about interior scatterers and often correspond to actual measurements. This article expresses far-field signal recovery in terms of time-domain convolutions, each between a solution multipole moment recorded at the boundary and a sum-of-exponentials kernel. Each exponential corresponds to a pole term in the Laplace transform of the kernel, a finite sum of simple poles. Greengard, Hagstrom, and Jiang have derived the large...
