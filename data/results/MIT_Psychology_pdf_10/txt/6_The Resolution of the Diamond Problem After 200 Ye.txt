论文标题: The Resolution of the Diamond Problem After 200 Years: Phonon, Roton and Magnon Induced Spin-Orbital Dynamics, Subshell Rehybridization and Shell Rotation for the Little Effect
作者: Reginald B. Little, Joseph Roache
摘要: The problem of the physicochemical synthesis of diamond spans more than 200 years, involving many giants of science. Many technologies have been discovered, realized and used to resolve this diamond problem. Here the origin, definition and cause of the diamond problem are presented. The Resolution of the diamond problem is then discussed on the basis of the Little Effect, involving novel roton-phonon driven (antisymmetrical) multi-spin induced orbital orientation, subshell rehybridization and valence shell rotation of radical complexes in quantum fluids under magnetization across thermal, pressure, compositional, and spinor gradients in both space and time. Some experimental evidence of this magnetic quantum Resolution is briefly reviewed and integrated with this recent fruitful discovery. Furthermore, the implications of the Little Effect in comparison to the Woodward-Hoffman Rule are considered. The distinction of the Little Effect from the prior radical pair effect is clarified. The...
