论文标题: Constraints on dark energy from H II starburst galaxy apparent magnitude versus redshift data
作者: Data Mania, Bharat Ratra
摘要: In this paper we use H II starburst galaxy apparent magnitude versus redshift data from Siegel et al. (2005) to constrain dark energy cosmological model parameters. These constraints are generally consistent with those derived using other data sets, but are not as restrictive as the tightest currently available constraints.
