作者: Roman Galactic Plane Survey Definition Committee
摘要: The Roman Galactic Plane Survey (RGPS) is a 700-hour program approved for early definition as a community-designed General Astrophysics Survey. It was selected following a proposal call for science programs that would benefit from an early community-based definition (Sanderson et al 2024). The community was invited to submit white papers and science pitches with a deadline of May 20, 2024; the Roman Galactic Plane Survey Definition Committee (RGPS-DC) first met on Sep 11, 2024. Based on the input provided, the RGPS-DC recommends a survey consisting of three elements: (1) a wide-field science element (691 sq deg, 541 hrs) covering the Galactic plane, Galactic latitude |b|&lt;2 deg and Galactic longitude l=+50.1 deg to -79 deg (281 deg), in four filters (F129, F159, F184, and F213) with higher latitude extensions for the bulge, the Serpens South/W40 star formation region, and Carina, (2) a time-domain science element (19 sq deg , 130 hrs) of six fields, including the full Nuclear Stellar...
