摘要: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution, while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning from the pre-treatment MRI...
