摘要: For a symplectic toric manifold we consider half-form quantization in mixed polarizations $\mathcal{P}_\infty$, associated to the action of a subtorus $T^p\subset T^n$. The real directions in these polarizations are generated by components of the $T^p$ moment map.   Polarizations of this type can be obtained by starting at a toric Kähler polarization $\mathcal{P}_0$ and then following   Mabuchi rays of toric Kähler polarizations generated by the norm square of the moment map of the torus subgroup. These geodesic rays are lifted to the quantum bundle via a generalized coherent state transform (gCST) and define equivariant isomorphisms between Hilbert spaces for the Kähler polarizations and the Hilbert space for the mixed polarization.   The polarizations $\mathcal{P}_\infty$ give a new way of looking at the problem of unitarity in the quantization commutes with reduction with respect to the $T^p$-action, as follows. The prequantum operators for the components of the moment map of the $T...
