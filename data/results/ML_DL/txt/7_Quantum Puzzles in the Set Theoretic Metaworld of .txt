论文标题: Quantum Puzzles in the Set Theoretic Metaworld of Heisenberg, Clauser, and Horne
作者: Ian T. Durham
摘要: This paper follows up on a recent pre-print (Durham [2005]) by first deriving a set theoretic relationship between the generalized uncertainty relations and the Clauser-Horne inequalities. The physical, metaphysical, and metamathematical implications and problems are then explored. The discussion builds on previous work by Pitowsky [1994] and suggests that there is a fundamental problem in quantum correlation that could potentially lead to a paradox. It leaves open the question of whether the problem is in experiment, theory, or phenomena.
