摘要: In their comment, Murphy et al. (arxiv:0708.3677) criticize the fitting procedure we used in two previous papers [Srianand et al. 2004(Paper I) and Chand et al. 2004 (Paper II)] and conclude that the above papers offers no stringent test to previous evidence for varying fine structure constant. We think this is a hasty conclusion as (a) our procedure is robust as shown in Paper II; (b) the data used by Murphy et al., in particular the error array, are different from ours and there are differences in the fitting procedure; (c) despite these differences, 70 per cent of their individual measurements are consistent with that quoted in Paper II. Our reanalysis using VPFIT with identical initial guess parameters leads to Δα/α= (0.01+/-0.15)x 10^{-5}$ for 21 systems (excluding two systems that deviate at more than 3$σ$ level) with very little scatter (χ^2_ν~1).
