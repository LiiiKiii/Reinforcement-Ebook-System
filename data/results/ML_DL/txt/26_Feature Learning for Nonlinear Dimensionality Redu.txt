作者: Takanori Fujiwara, Yun-Hsin Kuo, Anders Ynnerman, Kwan-Liu Ma
摘要: Dimensionality reduction (DR) plays a vital role in the visual analysis of high-dimensional data. One main aim of DR is to reveal hidden patterns that lie on intrinsic low-dimensional manifolds. However, DR often overlooks important patterns when the manifolds are distorted or masked by certain influential data attributes. This paper presents a feature learning framework, FEALM, designed to generate a set of optimized data projections for nonlinear DR in order to capture important patterns in the hidden manifolds. These projections produce maximally different nearest-neighbor graphs so that resultant DR outcomes are significantly different. To achieve such a capability, we design an optimization algorithm as well as introduce a new graph dissimilarity measure, named neighbor-shape dissimilarity. Additionally, we develop interactive visualizations to assist comparison of obtained DR results and interpretation of each DR result. We demonstrate FEALM's effectiveness through experiments an...
