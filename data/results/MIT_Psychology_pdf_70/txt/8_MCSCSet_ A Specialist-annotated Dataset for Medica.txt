摘要: Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) is gaining increasing attention due to its promise of automatically detecting and correcting spelling errors in Chinese texts. Despite its extensive use in many applications, like search engines and optical character recognition systems, little has been explored in medical scenarios in which complex and uncommon medical entities are easily misspelled. Correcting the misspellings of medical entities is arguably more difficult than those in the open domain due to its requirements of specificdomain knowledge. In this work, we define the task of Medical-domain Chinese Spelling Correction and propose MCSCSet, a large scale specialist-annotated dataset that contains about 200k samples. In contrast to the existing open-domain CSC datasets, MCSCSet involves: i) extensive real-world medical queries collected from Tencent Yidian, ii) corresponding misspelled sentences manually annotated by medical specialists. To ensure automated dataset curation, MCSCSet furthe...
