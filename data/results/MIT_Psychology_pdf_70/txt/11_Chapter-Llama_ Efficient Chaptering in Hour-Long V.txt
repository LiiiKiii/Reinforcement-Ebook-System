作者: Lucas Ventura, Antoine Yang, Cordelia Schmid, Gül Varol
摘要: We address the task of video chaptering, i.e., partitioning a long video timeline into semantic units and generating corresponding chapter titles. While relatively underexplored, automatic chaptering has the potential to enable efficient navigation and content retrieval in long-form videos. In this paper, we achieve strong chaptering performance on hour-long videos by efficiently addressing the problem in the text domain with our 'Chapter-Llama' framework. Specifically, we leverage a pretrained large language model (LLM) with large context window, and feed as input (i) speech transcripts and (ii) captions describing video frames, along with their respective timestamps. Given the inefficiency of exhaustively captioning all frames, we propose a lightweight speech-guided frame selection strategy based on speech transcript content, and experimentally demonstrate remarkable advantages. We train the LLM to output timestamps for the chapter boundaries, as well as free-form chapter titles. Thi...
