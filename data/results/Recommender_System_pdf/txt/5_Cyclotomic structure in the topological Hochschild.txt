摘要: Let $X$ be a finite CW complex, and let $DX$ be its dual in the category of spectra. We demonstrate that the Poincaré/Koszul duality between $THH(DX)$ and the free loop space $Σ^\infty_+ LX$ is in fact a genuinely $S^1$-equivariant duality that preserves the $C_n$-fixed points. Our proof uses an elementary but surprisingly useful rigidity theorem for the geometric fixed point functor $Φ^G$ of orthogonal $G$-spectra.
