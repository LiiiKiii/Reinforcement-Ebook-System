论文标题: Assessing Expert System-Assisted Literature Reviews With a Case Study
作者: Zhe Yu, Jeffrey C. Carver, Gregg Rothermel, Tim Menzies
摘要: Given the large number of publications in software engineering, frequent literature reviews are required to keep current on work in specific areas. One tedious work in literature reviews is to find relevant studies amongst thousands of non-relevant search results. In theory, expert systems can assist in finding relevant work but those systems have primarily been tested in simulations rather than in application to actual literature reviews. Hence, few researchers have faith in such expert systems. Accordingly, using a realistic case study, this paper assesses how well our state-of-the-art expert system can help with literature reviews.   The assessed literature review aimed at identifying test case prioritization techniques for automated UI testing, specifically from 8,349 papers on IEEE Xplore. This corpus was studied with an expert system that incorporates an incrementally updated human-in-the-loop active learning tool. Using that expert system, in three hours, we found 242 relevant p...
