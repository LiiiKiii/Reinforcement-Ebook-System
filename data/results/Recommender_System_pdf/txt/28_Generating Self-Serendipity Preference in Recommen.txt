作者: Yuanbo Xu, Yongjian Yang, En Wang
摘要: Classical accuracy-oriented Recommender Systems (RSs) typically face the cold-start problem and the filter-bubble problem when users suffer the familiar, repeated, and even predictable recommendations, making them boring and unsatisfied. To address the above issues, serendipity-oriented RSs are proposed to recommend appealing and valuable items significantly deviating from users' historical interactions and thus satisfying them by introducing unexplored but relevant candidate items to them. In this paper, we devise a novel serendipity-oriented recommender system (\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{S}erendipity \textbf{R}ecommender \textbf{S}ystem, \textbf{GS$^2$-RS}) that generates users' self-serendipity preferences to enhance the recommendation performance. Specifically, this model extracts users' interest and satisfaction preferences, generates virtual but convincible neighbors' preferences from themselves, and achieves their self-serendipity preference. Then these preference...
