摘要: We present a spectral analysis of three simultaneous NuSTAR and Swift/XRT observations of the transient Be-neutron star binary KS 1947+300 taken during its outburst in 2013/2014. These broad-band observations were supported by Swift/XRT monitoring snap-shots every 3 days, which we use to study the evolution of the spectrum over the outburst. We find strong changes of the power-law photon index, which shows a weak trend of softening with increasing X-ray flux. The neutron star shows very strong pulsations with a period of P ~ 18.8 s. The 0.8-79 keV broad-band spectrum can be described by a power-law with an exponential cutoff and a black-body component at low energies. During the second observation we detect a cyclotron resonant scattering feature at 12.5 keV, which is absent in the phase-averaged spectra of observations 1 and 3. Pulse phase-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the strength of the feature changes strongly with pulse phase and is most prominent during the broad minimum of ...
