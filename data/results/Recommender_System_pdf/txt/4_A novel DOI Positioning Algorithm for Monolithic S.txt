摘要: Monolithic crystals are examined as an alternative to segmented scintillator arrays in positron emission tomography (PET). Monoliths provide good energy, timing and spatial resolution including intrinsic depth of interaction (DOI) encoding. DOI allows reducing parallax errors (radial astigmatism) at off-center positions within a PET ring. We present a novel DOI-estimation approach based on the supervised machine learning algorithm gradient tree boosting (GTB). GTB builds predictive regression models based on sequential binary comparisons (decision trees). GTB models have been shown to be implementable in FPGA if the memory requirement fits the available resources. We propose two optimization scenarios for the best possible positioning performance: One restricting the available memory to enable a future FPGA implementation and one without any restrictions. The positioning performance of the GTB models is compared with a DOI estimation method based on a single DOI observable (SO) compara...
