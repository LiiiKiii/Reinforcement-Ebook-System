作者: Yiming Ai, Zhiwei He, Ziyin Zhang, Wenhong Zhu, Hongkun Hao
摘要: In this study, we delve into the validity of conventional personality questionnaires in capturing the human-like personality traits of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our objective is to assess the congruence between the personality traits LLMs claim to possess and their demonstrated tendencies in real-world scenarios. By conducting an extensive examination of LLM outputs against observed human response patterns, we aim to understand the disjunction between self-knowledge and action in LLMs.
