From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from World wide web ) Linked hypertext system on the Internet World Wide Web Abbreviation WWW, W3 Status Active Year started 1989 37 years ago ( 1989 ) First published 6 August 1991 34 years ago ( 1991-08-06 ) Organization CERN (1989–1994) W3C (1994–current) Authors Tim Berners-Lee License Public domain (Since April 1993) 1 A web page from Wikipedia displayed in Google Chrome The World Wide Web (also known as WWW , W3 , or simply the Web ) 2 is an information system that enables content sharing over the Internet using a graphical user interface. 3 It facilitates access to documents and other web resources according to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 4 The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1993. It was conceived as a "universal linked information system". 5 6 7 Documents and other media content are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through a character string called uniform resource locator (URL). The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). This markup language supports plain text , images , embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs), which provide immediate access to other web resources. Web navigation , or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. Web applications are web pages that function as application software. The information on the Web is transferred across the Internet using HTTP. Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name make up a website. A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers. Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organisations, government agencies, and individual users ; and comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government information. The World Wide Web has become the world's dominant information systems platform. 8 9 10 11 It is the primary tool that billions of people worldwide use to interact with the Internet. 4 This NeXT Computer was used by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at CERN and became the world's first Web server. The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN. 12 13 He was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organisation, as well as distributing them to collaborators outside CERN. In his design, Berners-Lee dismissed the common tree structure approach, used for instance in the existing CERNDOC documentation system and in the Unix filesystem , as well as approaches that relied on tagging files with keywords , as in the VAX/NOTES system. Instead, he adopted concepts he had put into practice with his private ENQUIRE system (1980), built at CERN. When he became aware of Ted Nelson 's hypertext model (1965), in which documents can be linked in unconstrained ways through hyperlinks associated with "hot spots" embedded in the text, it helped to confirm the validity of his concept. 14 15 The former World Wide Web logo, designed by Robert Cailliau. Currently, there is no widely accepted logo in use for the WWW. The model was later popularised by Apple 's HyperCard system. Unlike Hypercard, Berners-Lee's new system from the outset was meant to support links between multiple databases on independent computers, and to allow simultaneous access by many users from any computer on the Internet. He also specified that the system should eventually handle other media besides text, such as graphics, speech, and video. Links could refer to mutable data files, or even fire up programs on their server computer. He also conceived "gateways" that would allow access through the new system to documents organised in other ways (such as traditional computer file systems or the Usenet ). Moreover, he insisted that the system should be decentralised, without any central control or coordination over the creation of links. 6 16 12 13 Berners-Lee submitted a proposal to CERN in May 1989, without giving the system a name. 6 He got a working system implemented by the end of 1990, including a browser called WorldWideWeb (which became the name of the project and of the network) and an HTTP server running at CERN. As part of that development, he defined the first version of the HTTP protocol, the basic URL syntax, and implicitly made HTML the primary document format. The Web was a success at CERN and began to spread to other scientific and academic institutions.
