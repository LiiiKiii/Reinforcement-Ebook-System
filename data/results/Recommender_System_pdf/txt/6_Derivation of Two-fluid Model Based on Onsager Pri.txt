论文标题: Derivation of Two-fluid Model Based on Onsager Principle
作者: Jiajia Zhou, Masao Doi
摘要: Using Onsager variational principle, we study the dynamic coupling between the stress and the composition in polymer solution. In the original derivation of the two-fluid model [Doi and Onuki, J. Phys. II France {\bf 2}, 1631 (1992)], the polymer stress was introduced \emph{a priopri}, therefore a constitutive equation is required to close the equations. Based on our previous study of viscoelastic fluids with homogeneous composition [Phys. Rev. Fluids {\bf 3}, 084004 (2018)], we start with a dumbbell model for the polymer, and derive all dynamic equations using the Onsager variational principle.
