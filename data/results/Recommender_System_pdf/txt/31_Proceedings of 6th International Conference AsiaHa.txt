摘要: The sixth international conference AsiaHaptics 2024 took place at Sunway University, Malaysia on 28-30 October 2024. AsiaHaptics is an exhibition type of international conference dedicated to the haptics domain, engaging presentations accompanied by hands-on demonstrations. It presents the state-of-the-art of the diverse haptics (touch)-related research, including perception and illusion, development of haptics devices, and applications to a wide variety of fields such as education, medicine, telecommunication, navigation and entertainment. This proceedings volume is a valuable resource not only for active haptics researchers, but also for general readers wishing to understand the status quo in this interdisciplinary area of science and technology.
